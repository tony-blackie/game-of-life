# Game of life

### You need to have YARN installed to run this!

See installation guide here: https://yarnpkg.com/

`yarn`

`yarn start`
Run the app

`yarn test`
Run tests

`P.S.` Make sure to check out functional tests in
/src/Field/\_\_test\_\_/functional.test.ts

They turned out pretty cool :)

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
